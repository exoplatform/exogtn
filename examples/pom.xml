        This is not the default modules declaration, instead we use the "normal" profile that is activated when
        the development property is not set (to any value). This declaration only keeps the necessary for building
        in development mode, i.e it does not build the other samples.

        It works only for the tomcat version as the JBoss version requires the "extension" and "portal"
        modules to be built.

        So in short by default it will build everything as usual but if you declare the development=true property
        to the build, only the skins will be built.
